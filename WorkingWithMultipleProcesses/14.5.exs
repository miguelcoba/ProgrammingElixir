# Without the Process.flag(:trap_exit, true) line, the exit(:boom) of 
# the child doesn't kills the parent and the message is received by parent

# MESSAGE_RECEIVED: "bye bye!"
# MESSAGE_RECEIVED: {:DOWN, #Reference<0.0.3.40>, :process, #PID<0.141.0>, :boom}
# Nothing happened as far as I am concerned

# With the Process.flag(:trap_exit, true) line, the behavior is the same

# Does it matter that you werenâ€™t waiting for the notification from the 
# child when it exited? No, it doesn't matter. The child dying has no 
# consequences for the parent
