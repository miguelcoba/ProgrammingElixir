# Without the Process.flag(:trap_exit, true) line, the exit(:boom) of 
# the child immediatly kills the parent and no message is received by parent
# With the Process.flag(:trap_exit, true) line, the exit(:boom) of 
# the child is correctly received by the parent. Additionally the :exit
# message is also received by the parent

# Does it matter that you werenâ€™t waiting for the notification from the 
# child when it exited? No, it doesn't matter. As they are linked the 
# exiting of the child killed the parent too
